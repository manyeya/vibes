# Reference: Cinematic Storytelling in Web Design

Storytelling is the bridge between a functional interface and an emotional experience. In award-winning web design, we use **Scrollytelling** to guide the user through a curated narrative.

## 1. The Narrative Flow
Every high-end site should follow a "Film-like" structure:
- **The Hook (Hero)**: A visually explosive entry. Use oversized typography and mask reveals to grab attention within 2 seconds.
- **The Setup (Context)**: Introduce the brand voice. Use smooth scrolling to create a sense of professional calm.
- **The Journey (Middle)**: The bulk of the content. Break this into "Chapters" using clear section breaks or background color shifts.
- **The Climax (Showcase)**: The most complex visual part. This is where you use WebGL, intense parallax, or horizontal scrolls.
- **The Resolution (Footer)**: A high-impact closing. A massive footer is a staple of modern premium design.

## 2. Scrollytelling Techniques
- **Scroll Hijacking (Lenis)**: Essential for controlling the "feel" of the story. It makes animations feel linked to physical effort.
- **Triggered Revelations**: Elements should not just be there; they should "arrive." Use GSAP ScrollTrigger to fire animations as the user reaches specific story beats.
- **Dynamic Pacing**: Some sections should scroll fast, while others "stick" (sticky positioning) to force the user to focus on a key message.

## 3. Immersive Hooks
- **Bento Grids**: Use modular, magazine-like grids to organize diverse content types (video, text, image) into a cohesive story.
- **Depth of Field**: Use parallax to create a 3D sense of depth, with decorative elements floating at different speeds.
- **Micro-Copy**: Use kinetic typography (SplitType) to make the text itself part of the visual narrative.
